uinit -- smallest init possible

This init just executes scripts and reaps zombies. It does nothing more beyond that.

Included programs are:
shutdown: standard minimal shutdown(8) (also signals init when called as reboot, halt or poweroff)
spawn: reexecutes specified program until killed

The code is in public domain.
Thanks to Rich Felker's EWONTFIX blog post (http://ewontfix.com/14/) about sane init system.
Spawn program is inspired by ninit's spawn, but completely rewritten.
